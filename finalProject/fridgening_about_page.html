		<h3> The Fridgening by Brenda and Tina</h3>
		<p>We want to create a project that helps us learn more about how our 2 fridges survive 
		extended and frequent use by 40 people living on our hall. We want to look at statistics 
		about the refrigerator temperatures and also how often/how long they are open for. We 
		will collect our data using a pressure and temperature sensor. Following data collection, 
		we will write python scripts to meaningfully analyze the data we have collected and 
		present it in a fun and interactive website. Finally, in the spirit of the internet of things, 
		we want to add the functionality of an automated email if the refrigerator is open for 
		more than 5 minutes and a weekly digest with interesting statistics. </p>
